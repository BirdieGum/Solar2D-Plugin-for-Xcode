The Xcode-Corona-Editor project was discontinued about a year ago. ( Date of writing: May 22 th. 2016 )

Instead I have been working on a project called 'Corona Plugin for Xcode'. 
This project aims at turning Xcode into a full-blown IDE for Corona SDK/Enterprise/Cards.

#####If you are looking for pure Lua support visit this instead: http://www.shakebrowser.net/lua-for-xcode#####

The "Corona Plugin for Xcode" is heavily improved and polished in all areas compared to what is in this Github repository.
And lots of new features were added.

You are welcome to continue using the code in this repository for your own personal use... but I highly recommend the 'Corona Plugin for Xcode' - it is about 10x cooler!
