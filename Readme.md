This plugin adds a set of new features to Xcode turning it into an easy to use, smooth and efficient editor for pure Lua-based Solar2D projects. ( [Solar2D](http://www.solar2d.com) is a software development platform previously known as [Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com) ).

The plugin is also a great addition if you are working with Solar2D Native. In this case you will achieve an excellent workflow by being able to do both Solar2D/Lua code and native code side by side in Xcode.

This plugin was previously a paid plugin known as 'Corona Plugin for Xcode' but following the open source transition from CoronaSDK to Solar2D I decided to make it free and open too.
